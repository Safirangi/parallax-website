      <p>How Stars Are Formed</p>

        <p>
          All stars form in nebulae, which are huge clouds of gas and dust.
          Though they shine for many thousands, and even millions of years,
          stars do not last for ever. The changes that occur in a star over time
          and the final stage of its life depend on a star's size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nuclear reactions at the centre (or core) of a star provides energy
          which makes it shine brightly. This stage is called the 'main
          sequence'. The exact lifetime of a star depends very much on its size.
          Very massive stars use up their fuel quickly. This means they may only
          last a few hundred thousand years. Smaller stars use up fuel more
          slowly so will shine for several billion years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, the hydrogen which powers the nuclear reactions inside a
          star begins to run out. The star then enters the final phases of its
          lifetime. All stars will expand, cool and change colour to become a
          red giant. What happens next depends on how massive the star is.
        </p>
        <p>
          A smaller star, like the Sun, will gradually cool down and stop
          glowing. During these changes it will go through the planetary nebula
          phase, and white dwarf phase. After many thousands of millions of
          years it will stop glowing and become a black dwarf.
        </p>
        <p>
          A massive star experiences a much more energetic and violent end. It
          explodes as a supernova. This scatters materials from inside the star
          across space. This material can collect in nebulae and form the next
          generation of stars. After the dust clears, a very dense neutron star
          is left behind. These spin rapidly and can give off streams of
          radiation, known as pulsars.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the star is especially massive, when it explodes it forms a black
          hole.

            Stars form in huge clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. These
            areas of space are sometimes known as 'stellar nurseries' or 'star
            forming regions'.

          <h2>Average Star</h2>
          <p>
            Stars are massive, glowing balls of extremely hot gas (called
            plasma) in space. All the energy in a star is made in its centre, by
            a process called nuclear fusion. The star releases the energy as
            heat and light. This is what makes a star shine. The outward force
            generated by the fusion process is balanced by the inward pull of
            the star's gravity.

          <h2>Red Giant</h2>
          <p>
            Stars spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen nuclei in their core
            to create helium. When the hydrogen in the centre of a star runs
            out, the star begins to use hydrogen further out from its core. This
            causes the outer layers of the star to expand and cool. Over time,
            the star grows to more than 400 times its original size. As the star
            cools, it changes colour and glows redder. The star is now a red
            giant.

          <h2>Planetary Nebula</h2>
          <p>
            The planetary nebula phase is a final stage in a low-mass star's
            life. During this phase, the star sheds its outer layers. This
            creates an expanding, glowing shell of very hot gas. Despite the
            name, they have nothing to do with planets.

          <h2>White Dwarf</h2>
          <p>
            Low-mass stars turn into planetary nebulae towards the end of their
            red giant phase. At that point the star becomes highly unstable and
            starts to pulsate. This produces strong stellar winds which throw
            off the outer layers of the star. The outer layers drift away from
            the star leaving a small hot, bright core behind, called a white
            dwarf. The white dwarf gives of ultraviolet radiation which lights
            up the layers of gas around the star.
