      <p>How Supernovae Are Formed</p>
      <div class="glass">
        <p>
          Supernovae are huge explosions in space. They take place during the
          final stages of some stars' lives. When they erupt, one supernova can
          briefly shine brighter than a whole galaxy
        </p>
        <p>
          There are different types of supernovae. Type Ia are thermonuclear
          explosions. The most well known are core-collapse supernovae. These
          take place when a star at least 8 times the mass of the Sun, runs out
          of fuel.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a massive star reaches the final stages of its evolution, its
          core is made mostly of iron. The star cannot fuse elements heavier
          than iron. This means fusion stops. At this point, there is no outward
          pressure to balance the inward pull of its gravity. Gravity pulls all
          the material in the star towards its middle. This starts a sudden,
          rapid collapse of the star.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outer layers of the collapse inwards until they reach the core.
          They bounce of the surface of the dense iron core at around 30,000
          kilometres per second. This sends shock waves through the star. The
          shock waves cause the star to explode as a supernova.
        </p>
        <p>
          Huge amounts of energy are created during the collapse and new
          elements form in the process. The star brightens quickly, then
          gradually fades away leaving only core. During the explosion the core
          collapses down to create either a neutron star or a black hole.
        </p>
        <p>
          The material which was thrown out during the explosion surrounds the
          core. We call this a supernova remnant. It will eventually drift into
          space and become part of a huge cloud of dust and gas. New stars will
          form in this cloud. This is how elements made in the first stars were
          recycled to make everything in our Solar System, including us!

          <p>
            Stars form in huge clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. These
            areas of space are sometimes known as 'stellar nurseries' or 'star
            forming regions'.

          <h2>Massive Star</h2>
          <p>
            For a star to explode as a Type II supernova, it must be at several
            times more massive than the sun (estimates run from eight to 15
            solar masses). Like the sun, it will eventually run out of hydrogen
            and then helium fuel at its core.

          <h2>Red SuperGiant</h2>
          <p>
            A red supergiant occurs when a moderately massive star — perhaps
            8–40 solar masses in size — exhausts its hydrogen fuel, evolves off
            of the main sequence, and transitions to fusing helium within its
            core. As this occurs, the star's radius expands, causing its
            temperature to plummet.

          <h2>Supernova</h2>
          <p>
            When a red supergiant has burnt out most of its fuel it resulst in a
            gravitational collaps, lowering its volume making the star smaller.
            When it shrinks the temperature get higher resulting in the start of
            thermonuclear fusion emiting great force and a giant explosion in
            the form of a supernova. Either it transforms into a black hole or a
            neutron star.

          <h2>Black Hole</h2>
          <p>
            When the core collapses, the blast wave slams into the dense
            material above, which thwarts the explosion. Instead of creating a
            supernova, the star implodes, forming a black hole.

          <h2>Neutron Star</h2>
          <p>
            When a star explodes as a supernova, most of its matter is blown
            away into space to form a nebula (such as the Crab Nebula). The
            ultra-dense remnants of the imploding core which are left behind are
            known as a neutron star, as its electrons and protons are crushed
            together in the huge gravity to form neutrons.
